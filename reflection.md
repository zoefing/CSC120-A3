Response: It's a bit early to tell, but as of now, I prefer Python. It was much more intuitive to me, and my foundation was stronger. Another major factor at play here is that I'm learning this new language (Java) with a new programming style (OOP). 

This is a broad statement, but languages completely change the programming experience. Outside of coding structure and other technicalities, my workflow experience with Python and Java has been wildly different. 

Consulting the official Java documentation was easily the most helpful tool for me. Also, having another set of eyes look over my code when debugging (TA hours and talking with my peers) was super beneficial. I would definitely recommend working with others.
